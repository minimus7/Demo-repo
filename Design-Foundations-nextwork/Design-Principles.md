Karri Saarinen's Design Principles Applied to NextWork
Core Principles for Quality-Focused Learning Products

Commit to quality at leadership level

Make craft a priority in NextWork's learning platform
Define why quality matters: helping learners actually master skills, not just access content

Small, high-caliber teams

Build targeted features with focused teams rather than sprawling committees
Hire people who already demonstrate attention to craft in learning experiences

Connected responsibility, not handoffs

Avoid silos between product, design, and engineering
Everyone shares responsibility for the learning experience quality

Rotate responsibilities for fresh ideas

Prevent stagnation by rotating team members across learning features
Remember users care about experience, not your org chart

Specs are baseline, not finish line

View requirements as minimum standards
Excel beyond basic functionality to create memorable learning experiences

Quality ≠ perfection

Test with beta users before public release
Iterate toward polish while maintaining high standards

Be opinionated in design

Design for specific learning needs rather than trying to please everyone
Create clear value propositions for different learner types

Reduce scope to increase quality

Better to do a few learning features exceptionally well than many poorly
Quality happens through continuous refinement, not all at once

Flexible principles over rigid process

Establish values and principles rather than prescriptive methods
Connect team directly with users through shared channels

Balance data with intuition

Don't rely solely on metrics or A/B tests
Develop informed intuition about what creates effective learning experiences

Application to NextWork's Five Fatal Flaws
These principles directly address NextWork's mission to solve online learning's key problems:

Outsourced Learning Experience: Connected teams ensure guidance is built in, not bolted on
Access ≠ Learning: Quality-focused approach ensures features truly facilitate learning
Isolation: Opinionated design creates community-centered experiences
Industry Distrust: Craft-focused approach builds credibility with employers
Detachment from Problem-Solving: Direct user connections ensure practical application

Remember: In today's crowded market, quality is how NextWork will stand out. Success means hiring people who care about craft and can make informed decisions based on their expertise in learning design.
