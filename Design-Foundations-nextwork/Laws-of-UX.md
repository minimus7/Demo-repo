# Laws of UX

## Aesthetic-Usability Effect

- **Definition**: Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.
- **Takeaways**:
- An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people’s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better.
- People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product or service is aesthetically pleasing.
- Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems and prevent issues from being discovered during usability testing.

---

## Choice Overload

- **Definition**: The tendency for people to get overwhelmed when they are presented with a large number of options, often used interchangeably with the term paradox of choice.
- **Takeaways**:
- Too many options hurt users’ decision-making ability. How they feel about the experience as a whole can be significantly impacted as a result.
- When comparison is necessary, we can avoid choice overload by enabling side-by-side comparison of related items and options that require a decision (e.g., pricing tiers).
- We can avoid choice overload by optimizing our designs for the decision-making process and prioritizing the content shown to users at any moment (e.g., featured product).
- **Origins**: Overchoice or choice overload was first introduced by Alvin Toffler in his 1970 book, _Future Shock_.

---

## Chunking

- **Definition**: A process by which individual pieces of an information set are broken down and then grouped together in a meaningful whole.
- **Takeaways**:
- Chunking enables users to easily scan content and identify information that aligns with their goals.
- Structuring content into visually distinct groups with a clear hierarchy enables designers to align information with how people evaluate and process digital content.
- Chunking can help users understand underlying relationships by grouping content into distinctive modules.
- **Origins**: The word chunking comes from George A Miller's 1956 paper, “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information.”

---

## Cognitive Bias

- **Definition**: A systematic error of thinking or rationality in judgment that influences our perception of the world and our decision-making ability.
- **Takeaways**:
- We conserve mental energy by developing rules of thumb based on past experiences, which can lead to systematic errors in judgment.
- Understanding our own intrinsic biases may not eliminate them completely but can help us identify them and safeguard against fallacious reasoning.
- **Origins**: Introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1972.

---

## Cognitive Load

- **Definition**: The amount of mental resources needed to understand and interact with an interface.
- **Takeaways**:
- When the amount of information exceeds our cognitive capacity, tasks become difficult, and details are missed.
- Intrinsic cognitive load refers to the effort required to absorb new information, while extraneous cognitive load refers to unnecessary mental processing.
- **Origins**: Developed in the late 1980s by John Sweller.

---

## Doherty Threshold

- **Definition**: Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.
- **Takeaways**:
- Provide system feedback within 400 ms to keep users’ attention and increase productivity.
- Use perceived performance to improve response time and reduce the perception of waiting.
- **Origins**: Defined by Walter J. Doherty and Ahrvind J. Thadani in a 1982 research paper.

---

## Fitts’s Law

- **Definition**: The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
- **Takeaways**:
- Touch targets should be large enough for users to accurately select them and have ample spacing between them.
- **Origins**: Established by psychologist Paul Fitts in 1954.

---

## Flow

- **Definition**: The mental state in which a person is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus and enjoyment in the activity.
- **Takeaways**:
- Flow occurs when there is a balance between the difficulty of a task and the user's skill level.
- Design for flow by providing necessary feedback and optimizing system responsiveness.
- **Origins**: Coined by psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi in 1975.

---

## Goal-Gradient Effect

- **Definition**: The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.
- **Takeaways**:
- The closer users are to completing a task, the faster they work towards reaching it.
- Provide a clear indication of progress to motivate users.
- **Origins**: Proposed by Clark Hull in 1932.

---

## Hick’s Law

- **Definition**: The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
- **Takeaways**:
- Minimize choices when response times are critical to decrease decision time.
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps to decrease cognitive load.
- **Origins**: Formulated by psychologist William Edmund Hick in 1952.

---

## Jakob’s Law

- **Definition**: Users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
- **Takeaways**:
- Leverage existing mental models to create superior user experiences.
- **Origins**: Coined by Jakob Nielsen.

---

## Law of Common Region

- **Definition**: Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they share an area with a clearly defined boundary.
- **Takeaways**:
- Common region creates a clear structure and helps users understand the relationship between elements.
- **Origins**: Part of Gestalt psychology principles.

---

## Law of Proximity

- **Definition**: Objects that are near each other tend to be grouped together.
- **Takeaways**:
- Proximity helps establish relationships with nearby objects and aids in organizing information.
- **Origins**: Another principle of Gestalt psychology.

---

## Law of Prägnanz

- **Definition**: People will perceive ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible.
- **Takeaways**:
- The human eye likes to find simplicity and order in complex shapes.
- **Origins**: Proposed by Max Wertheimer in 1910.

---

## Law of Similarity

- **Definition**: The human eye tends to perceive similar elements as a complete picture or group.
- **Takeaways**:
- Elements that are visually similar will be perceived as related.
- **Origins**: Part of Gestalt psychology principles.

---

## Law of Uniform Connectedness

- **Definition**: Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than those with no connection.
- **Takeaways**:
- Use visual connections to emphasize relationships between similar items.
- **Origins**: Another principle of Gestalt psychology.

---

## Mental Model

- **Definition**: A compressed model based on what we think we know about a system and how it works.
- **Takeaways**:
- Match designs to users’ mental models to improve their experience.
- **Origins**: Proposed by Kenneth Craik in 1943.

---

## Miller’s Law

- **Definition**: The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
- **Takeaways**:
- Organize content into smaller chunks to help users process and memorize easily.
- **Origins**: Introduced by George A. Miller in 1956.

---

## Occam’s Razor

- **Definition**: Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
- **Takeaways**:
- The best method for reducing complexity is to avoid it in the first place.
- **Origins**: Attributed to William of Ockham.

- **Takeaways**:
- Limit the time to complete a task to improve user experience.
- **Origins**: Articulated by Cyril Northcote Parkinson in 1955.

---

## Peak-End Rule

- **Definition**: People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end.
- **Takeaways**:
- Pay close attention to the most intense points and the final moments of the user journey.
- **Origins**: Related to cognitive bias.

---
