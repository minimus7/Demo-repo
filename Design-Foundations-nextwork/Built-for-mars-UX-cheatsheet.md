# Hyperbolic Discounting

A cognitive bias which explains why people prefer smaller, immediate rewards rather than larger rewards in the future.
👀

#### Introduction

People are naturally impatient, and despite being good at _planning_ for the future, are usually terrible at making decisions that sacrifice _today_ for tomorrow.

- Choosing to eat junk food today, rather than focusing on long term health.
- Spending $100 today, rather than saving and investing that cash.
- Opting for a $100 reward today, rather than a $120 reward in a week.
  It's one of the reasons why payday loans are so effective—people can spend **_now_**.
  The present value of the reward is being discounted in a trend that follows a mathematical curve called a "hyperbola".

#### Potential impacts

**Churn**

- If the value of your app is very **_long term_** (e.g., investing, life insurance) you're constantly fighting people's short term preferences (i.e., seeing the cash leave their account, that they _could_ be spending).
  **Feature usage**
- Some of your features may be underused, if it's framed as a very long term benefit with short term trade-offs.
  **Habits**
- People slip into short term reward habits (both positive and negative).
- It's much harder to get people to stick to long-term habits.
  **Effort & motivation**

#### Product tips

This usually comes down to **framing**—can you explain the long term benefits, and why it's worth a short term sacrifice.
You just need to be aware that people have a preference for the short term, even if it's objectively a worse "deal".
e.g., people will likely choose $100 today over $102 tomorrow.

# Fresh Start Effect

People will often feel more motivated to do something (e.g., learn a new language) if it feels like a fresh start.
👀

#### Introduction

It's one reason why New Years resolutions can be so powerful—you can put aside the old failings, and start "fresh".

#### Potential impacts

**Conversion rates**

- Due to the fresh start, you may find people are more likely to convert near a specific event.
- e.g., a gym will likely see higher conversion rates in January, than in July.
  **Feature usage**  
  **Habits**
- Fresh starts are a fantastic entry point for new habits.
- e.g., healthier choices, new challenges, committing to specific goals.
  **Effort & motivation**
- People are motivated by the ability to _have_ a fresh start.

#### Product tips

- If your product is in a 'self help' category (e.g., learning, health), then consider fresh starts an important external trigger.
- Consider how you could **_encourage_** a fresh start, if the user comes back after a period of inactivity.
  Here are two examples from **Duolingo**:
- After failing a streak, you'll just start fresh—they don't dwell on the old failings, or even remind you about them.
- If you revisit the app after a longer period of inactivity, they'll ask if you want to start a fresh course (i.e., without all your old progress and failings).

# Tribalism

People enjoy feeling connected in tribes.
👀

#### Introduction

Although the days of people mostly living in small hunter-gatherer groups are behind us, humans still crave a connected experience with other people.
Of course, there are _literal_ and obvious tribes (e.g., religion, gangs, families), but consider that people who identify, and bond, over a specific _thing_ can create a pseudo-tribe.
For example, a group of people who all love World of Warcraft, could be considered a tribe.
Tribalism affects product design in many subtle ways, for instance:

- Sharing in-jokes and references.
- All competing for a common goal.
- A level of understanding about each other's motives.
  A simple way to think about tribalism, is that **any reference, joke, content or feature that makes the user feel _really understood_, can mimic the connectedness of a tribe**.

#### Product impacts

**Sharing & referrals**

- You're more likely to share something with a friend, if you believe that they'd be well-suited for the "tribe".
- e.g., if your friend also likes dogs, you'd be more likely to share a dog meme with them.
  **Happiness & enjoyment**
- It's more enjoyable to socially use a product where you feel part of a tribe.
- e.g., it'd be more fun to collect _old coins_, if you're part of an online community where you can talk to like minded people about what you've found.

#### Product tips

- How could you improve the _social_ aspect of your product or community? Can you connect like minded people?
- **In-jokes and niche references** can really make the user **_feel spoken to_**.

# Pattern Matching

Your brain is wired to seek shortcuts by trying to match patterns.
👀

#### Introduction

Imagine that you've written a short to-do list in your notes app, driven to the shops, and then reopened your notes.
You'll subconsciously (and very quickly) go through a process of **evaluating if the list is the same as what you were just looking at**.
And your brain takes a shortcut, by trying to match patterns.
i.e., in the above example, _even without reading the actual words_, you could quickly identify that they're very likely to be the same list.
The pattern of the words (e.g., their sizing, spacing, number of items) are very similar.
But now try that same exercise with the following:
It's much harder, because the **order of the items has changed**. Your brain recognises that the **pattern has broken** (the shape of the content), and now you need to engage more in the task.

#### Deeper dive

Pattern matching is everywhere

- Consistency of styles (e.g., input fields, font sizes, colours) allows people to pattern match between pages, screens and sessions.
- Consistent page components (e.g., heading, subtitle, paragraph and image) makes it quicker to quickly digest that every item on a page is the _same content type._
  Intentionally breaking patterns
  Occasionally, you'll want your users to **disengage autopilot**, and think about a specific task or decision.
  You can do this by intentionally breaking a specific design characteristic.
- A pop-up or modal (which is by nature, a change).
- New, or unique, heading styles or content.
- Introducing new colours or design cues.

#### Potential impacts

**Productivity & efficiency**

- Pattern matching is a shortcut to efficiency.
  **Attention & interest**
- People will pay more attention, if they notice that a pattern is broken. This can be both a positive and negative influence.
  **Effort & motivation**
- It takes more effort to navigate in a world without patterns.

# Specificity

Specific actions can be more effective than "general" ones.
👀

#### Introduction

Even if the ingredients are identical, a remedy for "back pain" can be more effective than a _generic_ painkiller.
Specific actions and solutions feel "_designed-for-purpose_", and the psychological effect can **_enhance_** the more 'real' benefits.
In medicine, it's similar to the very real benefits of a placebo.  
But it's also true for digital products. **_Specific actions can feel better_**, more satisfying and more intentional.

#### Potential impacts

**Input quality**

- By asking more specific questions, with context, you can usually collect better data.
  **Attention & interest**  
  **Anxiety**
- You can reduce the anxiety of taking an action, by being more specific with what will (and will not) happen.
- e.g., a button label of "_Pay £3.30 today_" creates less anxiety than "_Make payment_".

#### Product tips

- When **labelling CTAs**, the more specific you are, _generally_, the more comfortable the user will be in taking that action.

# Delegated Decisions

There are downsides to delegating key decisions to your users.
👀

#### Introduction

If you, as the product builder, are unsure of your user's needs (or desires), it can be tempting to simply delegate those decisions onto them.
For example, imagine that you're building a dashboard, and don't know what the "ideal" layout would be.
So, you just let the user have **full customisation** over how it looks, and which components go where.
It sounds okay in principle, but you:

- Give the user **more decisions** to make (you've just delegated it to them).
- Allowing the user to create **rubbish dashboards** (low efficiency, lower value).

#### Deeper dive

Common ways of avoiding delegation

- **Default filters and settings** — this is removing the initial decision of "_how should I be viewing this content_".
- **Default views and layouts** — e.g., when you use Stripe, you don't create your dashboard from scratch. They've optimized one for you.
- **Features on by default** — e.g., autocorrect is turned on by default, it'd be a waste of time to ask every user if they wanted it.

#### Potential impacts

**Churn**

- After signing up to your product, the user may be unable (or, not motivated enough) to create an efficient and productive tool.
- Or, they may find the constant need to make major decisions tiring.
  **Feature usage**
- Key decisions may show/hide features that the user would have used, but didn't understand enough at the time that they made the decision.
  **Productivity & efficiency**  
  **Anxiety**
- They may churn even at the _anxiety of having made the wrong decision_.
  **Complexity & understanding**
- At every decision, does the user understand exactly the trade-off that they are making, and the consequences?
  **Perception of value**

#### Product tips

In these instances, it's almost always better to:

- **Speak to your users**, and find out what they're trying to achieve.
- **Look at the data**, and try to analyse what they're doing.
  When to delegate decisions
  Does this mean that you _never_ let the user make any decisions? No, of course not.
  But you need to be careful about delegating **_significant_** decisions, without considering the following:
- Does the user really understand the impact of this decision? Could you give them more context?
- Is there a possibility that the user is about to make a short-sighted decision, that in the end limits the value that they get from the product?

# Confirmation Bias

We have a tendency to interpret (or seek out) information that is consistent with our beliefs.
👀

#### Introduction

This is a bias that is often unintentional, and leads to poor decision-making.
Often it also means ignoring new information that would contradict those beliefs.

#### Deeper dive

Types of Confirmation Bias:
There are 3 main components at play, which affect us all (to some extent):

- A biased **search** — i.e., only seeking out information that agrees with your existing beliefs.
- A biased **interpretation** — i.e., processing objectively neutral information as backing up your beliefs.
- A biased **memory** — i.e., only remembering information that agrees with your beliefs.

#### Potential impacts

**Attention & interest**

- Users might be less interested in products, features and content that contradicts their existing beliefs.
  **Happiness & enjoyment**
- Most people don't enjoy being challenged on their opinions.

# Curiosity Gap

When presented with obviously-incomplete information, people have a tendency to try and fill in the blanks.
👀

#### Introduction

People often even experience a _craving_ to complete the information.
The human brain is keen to solve puzzles—for example, what is the car that people are so excited about below?
The wheels are a clue. You might not even care, but it's hard to **_not_** want to know.
This is why clickbait titles work so well.

#### Deeper dive

Not the Knowledge Gap:
The Knowledge Gap refers to information that the user _must_ know, in order to complete a task. i.e., a gap in their knowledge.
The Curiosity Gap is more the tendency to find missing information, even if it's _not necessary_ for them to solve. i.e., a curious omission, like a missing puzzle piece.

#### Potential impacts

**Conversion rates**

- It can help people reach a non-financial goal, if there's an open loop (i.e., incomplete information). An example of this is _retention on YouTube_.
  **Attention & interest**
- Open loops will often increase attention and interest, as people seek to solve the missing information.
  **Effort & motivation**  
  **Complexity & understanding**  
  ⚡️

#### Examples

MorningBrew
Mid-email puzzles
Buzzfeed
Hiding half an image
LinkedIn
Hidden behind a paywall

# Familiarity Bias

People have a tendency to prefer (i.e., choose) products, services and options that feel familiar to them.
👀

#### Introduction

People often prefer what is familiar. They may even actively avoid considering new options.  
This is also occasionally called the Mere Exposure Effect.

#### Deeper dive

To utilise this bias, it's helpful to understand why it works.
In short, it helps humans to make quick judgements:

1. It **reduces uncertainty**
2. It's **quicker to interpret**
   Imagine that you're walking through the serengeti, and you turn to see this:
   Your life depends on your ability to process this, and make a snap judgement about what you should do next.
   You don't want to waste valuable seconds deciding if it's a lion, a rarer breed of cat or a man in a lion suit. You have a bias towards what you're familiar with (a lion), and so you run.
   This bias was necessary for our survival, and our brains have been trained to **_gravitate towards the familiar_**.

#### Potential impacts

**Conversion rates**  
**Productivity & efficiency**

- It's easier, and more efficient, to use something that you're already familiar with, obviously.
- The key is that it can also be more efficient to use a product that's **similar** to something you already know.
  **Sharing & referrals**
- When sharing a product, people will intuitively try and compare it to something that the other person knows. e.g., "_it's like Airbnb, but for boats_".
  **Attention & interest**  
  **Complexity & understanding**
- If you want to make it easier for people to understand how to use your product, you can make it similar to something that _already know_ how to use.

# Hawthorne Effect

People modify their behaviour under observation.
👀

#### Introduction

The Hawthorne effect refers to a tendency in some individuals to alter their behaviour in response to their awareness of being observed.
This is why it's so often difficult to get 'true' UX feedback. The act of watching a new user (or asking them about their experience), may alter what they do.
_i.e., they may spend longer reading an onboarding tooltip, if they know that they're being watched, as skipping it would feel rude or lazy._
As an example, a study found that medical staff were 55% more likely to wash their hands, if they _knew_ that they were being monitored.
If the Hawthorne Effect can be _that_ influential in a situation where the benefits are so unambiguous, and from a field of professionals, you can only imagine how inaccurate user testing can be.

#### Potential impacts

**Feature usage**

- When users know that they're being actively monitored, they will exaggerate or modify their behaviour.
- e.g., if you knew you were being watched, you might bother to read a service's onboarding more carefully—because you might guess that you'd be tested on what you read later.
  **Input quality**
- When asked, users will often lie (or exaggerate) their true feelings.
- "_Oh, I'd love to pay for this, I'd use it every day_". (But then doesn't).

# Reactive Onboarding

Reactive onboarding is a method of educating users about your product, by explaining what, and why something happened.
👀

#### Introduction

This is particularly useful when your app has lots of functionality that may not be necessary to learn, and it'd be impractical to force the user to acknowledge it immediately.

#### Potential impacts

**Feature usage**  
**Productivity & efficiency**

- Highlighting _what just happened_, and how you can change your behaviour in the future, can be a great way of teaching users to be more productive and efficient.
  **Attention & interest**
- Reactive onboarding, by design, commands attention. i.e., "_look what just happened_".
  **Complexity & understanding**

#### Product tips

- It's not enough just to identify _what happened_ (i.e., the trigger), you also need to explain **why** it happened, and what the **consequences** are.
- Remember that reactive onboarding can happen over multiple sessions, days, weeks and months. The user doesn't _have_ to be taught about that feature the first time they hit that trigger.
  📙

# User Delight

Small moments of delight can have an outsized impact on how users perceive the entire experience.
👀

#### Introduction

One key consideration is that these small moments don't always _objectively_ provide the user any additional value—instead, they're fun, cheerful or inspiring.  
In other words, it's optimised to be enjoyable or notable.

#### Potential impacts

**Habits**

- Small moments of joy can be utilised to create a positive loop (i.e., do _this_ and _this_, and then you'll get this awesome moment of delight).
  **Sharing & referrals**
- People often share these moments organically.
  **Happiness & enjoyment**

#### Product tips

Risks:
When executed poorly, these moments can come across gimmicky.
For example, if your doctors surgery started every email with "_Hey, what's up dude_", it'd feel tone-dead  
⚡️

#### Examples

TunnelBear
Digging your VPN tunnel
Dominos
Shake-to-shuffle
McDonalds
Chips go flying

# Ego Depletion

After exerting energy on a task, you may be less motivated to start another.
👀

#### Introduction

If you have to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge presents itself.
i.e., unless you're given a **_strong incentive_** to do so, people will often feel demotivated to continue with tasks, even if it's towards a goal that they want to achieve.
This is one reason why you're far more likely to snack on ice cream in the evenings, _after a long day_, than in the morning. Your ability to make a healthy decision (self-control) has been impeded.

#### Deeper dive

Physical depletion
A discovery made by Baumeister, shows that ego depletion is not just a metaphor, but a **measurable biological process**.
The nervous system consumes more glucose as the brain completes effortful tasks (such as decision-making, self-control or moderate cognitive exercise).
Having low glucose increases the likelihood that you'll give in to an easier route, or give up entirely. **It becomes harder to do hard things**.

#### Potential impacts

**Conversion rates**

- Users may come to your service, _**already depleted**_, and not convert.
- To offset ego depletion, incentives are crucial to engage and motivate people.
  **Input quality**
- Bored or tired users input worse data.
  **Effort & motivation**
- Long sign-up processes, or those with a high _cognitive load_, may be exhausting users.

#### Product tips

- Be concise and try to **reduce cognitive load**.
- Offer strong and **clear incentives**.
- Give the user natural chances to pause, and reset (i.e., they don't need to learn every feature right away).

# Serial Position Effect

When presented with a list of things, people are better at remembering the first and last items, than those in the middle.
👀

#### Introduction

This is a practical design principle based on two concepts:

- The Anchor Effect—_people become anchored to the first piece of information they see._
- The Recency Bias—_people are better at remembering the most recent thing they've seen._

#### Potential impacts

**Purchases**

- If you sell multiple products (tiers), then the order that they're presented is likely to influence which options people select.
  **Attention & interest**  
  **Complexity & understanding**
- If you're trying to explain a lot of things (i.e., features or benefits), the position makes a difference.
  **Perception of value**
- Similar to the Anchor Effect.

#### Product tips

- When creating lists (or bullets, like this), **consider the _order_ as an important decision** (i.e., important stuff at the beginning or end).
- During onboarding, **show a killer feature right away**. Don't start gentle (and boring), with a dull feature.
- Keep lists **concise**.

# Social Proof

People adapt their behaviour based on others. Our subconscious shortcut is to use social proof, and look at what others are doing.
👀

#### Introduction

People are constantly seeking evidence to evaluate a new experience (e.g., a product, service, or holiday).  
It's essentially the basis for reviews and testimonials, although can be used in much more subtle ways.

#### Potential impacts

**Conversion rates**

- Social proof can have a huge impact to conversion rates, particularly in a checkout.
  **Purchases**  
  **Sharing & referrals**
- You're more likely to share a product with friends, if you believe that other people are also sharing it with their friends.
  **Perception of value**
- People attribute more value to a product that they _believe_ other people like.
- This is even more influential when it's friends or trusted experts.

#### Deeper dive

Common types of social proof:

- Reviews, ratings and testimonials
- Displaying the number of followers or friends
- Logos of clients and customers
- Showing which of _your_ friends also use a product
- Showing the total _number_ of people who use a product or service

#### Product tips

The more 'real' the social proof, the more effective it seems to be.
For instance, knowing that your real-life friend uses a product, is far more persuasive than if it were a stranger using a product.
Specificity of social proof enhances the effect.  
⚡️

#### Examples

Stripe
Customer stories
Clubhouse
Showing faces
Google
Review views

# Reverse Prototype

A method of removing existing functionality, views and steps, to see what the minimal viable product is.
👀

#### Introduction

If you're starting with nothing, and designing your first product, you'd likely start by asking what the necessary features were to deliver value (and your vision).
This process is often named an MVP (minimal viable product).
A **reverse prototype** is a method of reaching this same MVP, but starting with a live product and **removing unnecessary functionality**.

#### Deeper dive

You may wonder why (and when) this would be necessary, so let's give a few examples:

- You've been building a product for a growing audience, but over time have built many features that you're not convinced are valuable to _every_ user. You may aim for a **_niche-specific MVP_**.
- Your product has been built over decades, as users, tastes, industry best-practice, technology and context has changed. You now **no longer know what's necessary**, and what people just are used to having.
- You're trying to **paywall specific features**, but aren't sure what's necessary for 'core value', and what are paid 'nice-to-haves'.

#### Potential impacts

**Churn**

- By reducing complexity, you may also reduce frustration and confusion, thereby _reducing churn_.
- It is also possible that by removing features, you _increase churn_, as some users no longer feel that it's sufficient for their workflow.
  **Feature usage**
- Clearly, adding or removing features will have a direct and indirect impact on what your users do.
- The remaining features will likely see _more_ attention.
  **Productivity & efficiency**
- By making your product simpler, people may be more efficient.
- e.g., after removing unnecessary (and unused) functionality in a dashboard, it'll be easier to use what remains.
  **Complexity & understanding**  
  **Perception of value**
- People don't like paying for features that they _don't use_, it can distort the perception of value.
- "_Ah, the subscription is $100, but I only need 3 of the features, I don't want to overpay for the rest_".

#### Product tips

A good start is to theorise which features are no longer necessary, but you'll still get confusing feedback from both users, and internal teams:

- "_We spent 12 months building that feature, we can't remove it_"
- "_This feels like a step backwards_"
- "_Why would we remove that, it's only one button, it's not in the way_"
  The real test requires data.
  **If you remove this feature, does anybody miss it\*\***?\*\* Or rather; what impact did it have on broad usage? Is that a positive change?
  A reverse prototype is aiming to tip over "too far", _it's only by tipping too far, that you can work out what really was necessary_.

# Decision Fatigue

People find it harder to make rational decisions, as the total number of decisions that they've made increases.
👀

#### Introduction

After a whole day of making hard decisions at work, you may find it hard to decide what to eat for dinner (comparatively simple).

#### Potential impacts

**Conversion rates**

- The increasing difficulty of answering questions may lead people to _avoid making them_. This may manifest as **churn**.
  **Habits**
- It's harder to adopt a new habit if you're tired (physically or mentally). You seek defaults.
  **Input quality**  
  **Effort & motivation**

#### Product tips

- Don't be afraid to split a 'user journey' into **multiple sessions**, and encourage the user to explore at their own pace. (i.e., don't teach them everything at once).
- Set good **default options**, where possible.
  📙

# The Scarcity Effect

A limited supply of something encourages action.
👀

#### Introduction

People will feel pressured to make a decision (e.g., to purchase an item, or sign up to a trial), if they believe that there is a limited supply, or a limited time to act.  
For example:

- "Only 4 remaining"
- "Only 3 days left to redeem this offer"

#### Potential impacts

**Conversion rates**

- A limited supply (of more or less anything) can incentivise people to convert (make a purchase).
  **Purchases**  
  **Sharing & referrals**
- People may be more incentivised to invite their friends, if they believe that the supply is limited.
- "_It's now or never_".

#### Product tips

Faux scarcity:
You'll often see companies create faux scarcity, with unrealistic offers "for today only"—occasionally with a tacky countdown timer.
This is a terrible experience, because if the user comes back and sees the same offer, they'll question your integrity.I
Instead, it's much more effective in the long run to utilise **scarcity when it's real**.

#### Experiments to try

- If a product _really does_ have a limited supply (or limited time to act), try telling your customers.
  ⚡️

#### Examples

Airbnb
This is a 'rare find'

# Recency Bias

A cognitive bias, often called the 'availability heuristic', is where people will favour recent events over historic ones.
👀

#### Introduction

As an example, when presented with a list of things to remember, people are more likely to remember both the first and last items, than those in the middle.  
People also overestimate the _probability_ of an event happening again, immediately after it has happened.
For instance, people who have just won the lottery may perceive that they have a greater chance of winning again, despite knowing that the odds are the same as they were the previous week.

#### Potential impacts

**Sharing & referrals**

- If the most recent experience of your product was negative, the user will be far less likely to recommend it to a friend (i.e., even if 99% of the other interactions have been positive).
  **Attention & interest**
- People pay more attention to recent experiences.
  **Complexity & understanding**  
  **Perception of value**  
  **Happiness & enjoyment**
- If the most recent experience was positive, then the user's general opinion of your service will also be more positive.
  ✌️

#### Product tips

- When doing a product demo, showcase your best features at the beginning or the end.
- Keep lists of important content short, as people will find it harder to remember those in the middle.
- If your users hit an error, they may have an unfavourable opinion of how buggy your product is for a while, so don't let obvious issues stick around.

# Overjustification Effect

If users are being incentivised to complete a task, especially with money or 'rewards', they can be less motivated than they otherwise would be.
👀

#### Introduction

People are deeply motivated to do certain things because of their intrinsic value (i.e., how it makes them feel), rather than an obvious external benefit (like money).
For example, you may pick up litter that you see in the street, because you want a cleaner neighbourhood. But you may resent being paid to pick up litter.
The overjustification effect, explains how **the 'incentive' distorts the original intent**, despite objectively being the same task.

#### Deeper dive

A more product-related example would be being **financially incentivised to invite your friends to an app**.
If you genuinely believe that they'd benefit from the service, sharing it is a well-intended act. Your incentive is to help your friend (and possibly making your experience better).
But if that same app paid you £3 for every referral, your friend's account has a **value**. You may perceive an invitation as being worth _more_ than £3.
It may also feel disingenuous, despite being the same action.

#### Potential impacts

**Conversion rates**  
**Sharing & referrals**

- "_Invite your friends to BlobSpace, and earn $2.50 when they join_" is likely to be off-putting to most people.
- Instead, non-financial incentives (such as _BlobSpace Premium Membership_) is often more effective.
  **Effort & motivation**
- Motivation is directly tied to incentives. The point here is that some external incentives (e.g., money) distort a more natural and internal incentive (e.g., playing games with my friends).
  **Perception of value**
- If you were paid $2 for inviting a friend, you've anchored the _value_ of your service to a low number.

#### Product tips

Here are some examples of _good_ incentives:

- Monetary **value** **of your product** — "$10 of free Instagram advertising, when you refer a local business".
- **Unlocking features** — "Get 1tb more storage on DropBox when you refer a friend".
- Limited supply rewards — "First 1,000 people to refer a friend get a limited edition pin badge".

# The Labour Illusion

People have a tendency to perceive products and services more favourably when they're aware of the effort that was put in to create it.
👀

#### Introduction

This is often called _A\_\_rtificial waiting_, and is one reason why fancy restaurants will have open kitchens.  
Or for a more abstract example, why do people think the Egyptian pyramids are impressive? Because it took a lot of effort (and skill).

#### Potential impacts

**Conversion rates**

- A greater perception of value can improve conversion rates.
  **Purchases**  
  **Perception of value**
- This is the foundation of this principle. People usually associate more value to something that they knew took a lot of effort.

#### Product tips

Here are some of the most common ways that services will leverage the Labour Illusion:

- **Fake spinners**—to keep you waiting, thinking that a server is doing something really smart.
- **Fake loading bars**—if your 'personalised dashboard' loaded too quickly, people might assume that nothing really happened.
- **Fake steps**—adding a faux step of "verifying" or "processing", to make the user think that something special is happening.
- **Mentioning how long something took to create**—for example, saying that each case study takes me about 50 hours to create (_which is true_).
  ⚡️

#### Examples

Netflix
Selecting movies for you

# Cognitive Load

The 'working memory' required to complete a task.
👀

#### Introduction

The theory is that the potential of your short-term memory is limited, and the brain cannot process an infinite number of 'things'.
Although hard to accurately measure, the cognitive load refers to the amount of strain your processing unit (brain) is under, at that moment.

#### Deeper dive

Plenty of products have a high cognitive load—it doesn't necessarily make something bad.
For example, playing a fast-paced video game like Call of Duty requires a lot of concentration, and demands 'processing power' (of your brain).  
You need both _attention_ and _interest_ to handle the cognitive load, but everyone will break eventually.
What you need to be mindful of is having a high cognitive load, on something that _isn't_ enjoyable (or interesting).

#### Potential impacts

**Churn**

- People will actively churn from highly stressful situations.
  **Input quality**
- A high cognitive load can limit cognitive function. i.e., people will perform worse at exams if they're under a great stress.
- For input forms (sign-up / onboarding), this can manifest in the user just selecting the easiest options (defaults).
  **Productivity & efficiency**  
  **Effort & motivation**  
  **Discomfort & frustration**
- A high cognitive load can lead to frustration and stress. It's uncomfortable to be under a high cognitive load.
  **Happiness & enjoyment**

# Law of Minimal Effort

People subconsciously (think, automatically), will often opt for the path of minimal effort.
👀

#### Introduction

Laziness is hard-wired into our system, and people will unknowingly opt for the path of minimal effort.
Importantly, this is **without even being aware that they are taking such a shortcut**.

#### Deeper dive

A puzzle
It's easier to show you this, rather than explain it.
_Look at the puzzle below:_

- **A bat and ball costs £1.10.**
- **The bat costs 1 pound (£) more than the ball.**
- **_How much does the ball cost?_**
  Most people would answer the obvious: the ball costs £0.10. And they'd be wrong.
  The answer
  If the bat costs £1.00 _more_ than the ball, then the _ball costs £0.05_ (the bat costs £1.05).
  This is a puzzle that initially seems easy, and most people who could objectively answer it correctly, wouldn't have, because they **unknowingly took the path of least effort**.
  They settled on the first answer the was feasibly correct, rather than investing the small amount of effort required to check their initial judgement.
  This is how people navigate the world, including digital products.
  The bat and ball study
  This bat and ball study, which was from the book '_Thinking, fast and slow_', explains that more than 50% of students at Harvard, MIT and Princeton gave the intuitive (and incorrect) answer.
  At less selective universities, the failure rate was **above 80%**.

#### Product impacts

**Feature usage**

- If a feature looks daunting to use, and there's a viable option to not bother, the user will be tempted to take the path of least effort.
  **Habits**
- Habits are, by their very nature, a way for people to operate on autopilot (i.e., without exerting too much effort).
- It's easier to maintain a habit, than it is to break one.
  **Attention & interest**  
  **Effort & motivation**
- As a broad rule of thumb, people will try and exert as little effort as possible. If you want people to put in more effort, you'll need to motivate them.
  **Complexity & understanding**
- People will put minimal effort into _learning_ how your service works—despite it saving them time and effort in the long run.
- Education is rarely low effort.

# Progressive Disclosure

The art of progressively exposing complications.
👀

#### Introduction

Users are less likely to be overwhelmed, if they're progressively (gently) exposed to complications.
It's the psychology equivalent of '_don't run before you can walk'_.
