Here are the key summary points and main takeaways for a product designer from the article "Data is a Design Tool" by Tom Johnson:

- **Data Is Essential, Not Optional**: Data is described as the pulse of your product. It's not about replacing intuition or gut feelings, but about understanding how your product is truly being used by real users, beyond just what they say in research sessions.

- **Designers Should Be Data-Savvy**: While you don't need to write SQL, manage ETL pipelines, or do advanced programming, you should understand:

  - How your data is stored and structured.
  - The basics of how user actions are recorded and processed.
  - What product metrics matter (feature adoption, sign-ups, drop-off points, user cohorts, etc.).

- **Data Empowers Design Decisions**: Knowing if a feature is unused, where users drop off, or unexpected spikes in user flows allows you to:

  - Optimize journeys.
  - Remove user friction.
  - Be proactive in catching problems early.
  - Make better-informed design decisions and advocate for your ideas.

- **Historically, Designers Lack Data Access**: Security concerns and technical barriers often prevent designers from independently accessing product data, forcing them to rely on developers, ticketing systems, or outdated spreadsheets.

- **AI Changes the Equation**: With advances in AI, designers no longer need to be experts at coding or data querying to explore and understand product data. Plain language queries and unstructured data exploration are becoming accessible.

- **Data Enables Influence and Collaboration**: Data is the driver for:

  - Gaining buy-in from stakeholders.
  - Collaborating with PMs, developers, and sales.
  - Demonstrating the value of your work and advocating for raises or promotions.

- **Mindset Shift**: Use data not to make every decision, but to frame the right questions, validate your intuition, and understand reality—the difference between what users say and what they do.

**Core Message:**  
Data is a powerful tool for designers—when accessible and used wisely, it helps you understand, communicate, optimize, and demonstrate the value of great design. AI is dissolving traditional barriers, so designers should embrace data as a critical part of the design toolkit[1].
